Hello there! My name is Susan, and I am a student at learning coding. I think programming is a super efficient way to organize the amount of data received in this world and look forward to organizing it in a recognizable and applicable way. By learning to code and using Github, I hope to see what other exciting projects are out there and what can be done.
